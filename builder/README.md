# Alpine Linux Bootstrap Builder

This bootstrap generates a clean rootfs and docker container. 

## Options
* `-r | --repository <repo>`: Custom Alpine Linux Repo
* `-R | --release <release>`: Set release version instead of the default latest-stable
* `-a | --arch <arch>`: Set the arch for the rootfs image that is needed


# Alpine Linux rootfs Builder

This builder image constructs a Alpine Linux `rootfs.tar.gz` for us to use when building the base Alpine Linux image. The `mkimage-alpine.sh` script does all the heavy lifting. During the configuration of the image we add our `apk-install` convenience script.

## Options

The builder takes several options:

* `-r <release>`: The release tag to use (such as `edge` or `v3.1`).
* `-m <mirror>`: The mirror URL base. Defaults to `http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine`.
* `-s`: Outputs the `rootfs.tar.gz` to stdout.
* `-c`: Adds the `apk-install` script to the resulting rootfs.
* `-e`: Adds extra `edge/main` and `edge/testing` pins to the repositories file.
* `-d`: Disables su to root by removing the blank root password.
* `-E`: Does not add `community` to the repositories file (necessary for versions without a community repo).
* `-t <timezone>`: Sets the timezone.
* `-p <packages>`: Comma-separated packages list. Default is `alpine-base`.
* `-b`: Extracts `alpine-base` to the rootfs without dependencies. For images slimmed down with `-p` which still want `/etc/*-release` and `/etc/issue`.

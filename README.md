A super small Docker image based on [Alpine Linux][alpine]. The image is only 5 MB and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images.

## Why?

Docker images today are big. Usually much larger than they need to be. There are a lot of ways to make them smaller, but the Docker populace still jumps to the `ubuntu` base image for most projects. The size savings over `ubuntu` and other bases are huge:

```
REPOSITORY          TAG           IMAGE ID          VIRTUAL SIZE
gliderlabs/alpine   latest        9cfff538e583      4.803 MB
debian              latest        19134a8202e7      123.1 MB
ubuntu              latest        104bec311bcd      129 MB
centos              latest        67591570dd29      191.8 MB
```

There are images such as `progrium/busybox` which get us very close to a minimal container and package system. But these particular BusyBox builds piggyback on the OpenWRT package index which is often lacking and not tailored towards generic everyday applications. Alpine Linux has a much more complete and up to date [package index][alpine-packages]:

```console
$ docker run progrium/busybox opkg-install nodejs
Unknown package 'nodejs'.
Collected errors:
* opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package nodejs.

$ docker run gliderlabs/alpine apk add --no-cache nodejs

```

This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. [Read more about Alpine Linux here][alpine-about] and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.

## Usage

Stop doing this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu-debootstrap:14.04
RUN apt-get update -q \
  && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -qy mysql-client \
  && apt-get clean \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt
ENTRYPOINT ["mysql"]
```
This took 19 seconds to build and yields a 164 MB image. Eww. Start doing this:

```dockerfile
FROM gliderlabs/alpine:3.4
RUN apk add --no-cache mysql-client
ENTRYPOINT ["mysql"]
```

Only 3 seconds to build and results in a 36 MB image! Hooray!

## Inspiration

The motivation for this project and modifications to `mkimage.sh` are highly inspired by Eivind Uggedal (uggedal) and Luis Lavena (luislavena). They have made great strides in getting Alpine Linux running as a Docker container. Check out their [mini-container/base][mini-base] image as well.
